This repository showcases a modular Go implementation featuring a reusable greetings package and robust test suite. The core greetings module provides greeting generation logic with proper error handling for invalid inputs. Comprehensive tests demonstrate Go's testing framework capabilities, including two key test cases: a valid input test using regex word boundaries (\b) for precise name matching, and an edge case test validating empty input handling. The tests utilize formatted error reporting with %q, %v, and %#q verbs for clear failure diagnostics. This implementation exemplifies Go best practices including separation of concerns, test-driven development, and precise validation - serving as both a functional module and educational resource for Go's testing patterns. The included Tour of Go reference provides pathways for further language exploration.
